"Above- and belowground phenology responses of subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) to soil warming, precipitation exclusion and their interaction.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.173147,"Plant phenology plays an important role in nutrient cycling and carbon balance in forest ecosystems, but its response to the interaction of global warming and precipitation reduction remains unclear. In this study, an experiment with factorial soil warming (ambient, ambient +5 °C) and precipitation exclusion (ambient, ambient -50 %) was conducted in a subtropical Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantation. We investigated the effects of soil warming, precipitation exclusion, and their interactions on Chinese fir phenology involving tree height and fine root growth. In the meantime, the impact of tree height growth and related climatic factors on fine root production was also assessed. The results showed that: (1) more variable phenology responses were observed in fine root growth than in tree height growth to the climatic treatments; the duration of fine root growth and tree height growth was significantly reduced by the precipitation exclusion and warming treatment, respectively; phenology differences of fine root and tree height growth caused by the solo warming and precipitation exclusion treatment were further enhanced by the combined treatment; and despite the greater inter-annual phenology stability of tree height growth than that of fine root growth, both of them showed insignificant response to all the climate treatments; (2) asynchrony of phenology between tree height and fine root growth was significantly enlarged by solo warming and precipitation exclusion treatments, and further enlarged by the combined treatment; (3) fine root production was significantly and positively correlated with air, and soil temperature, and tree height growth as well, which was altered by warming and precipitation exclusion treatments. Our results demonstrated that climatic changes significantly and differently alter phenology of, and extend the phenology asynchrony between, above and below ground plant components, and also highlight the climate-sensitive and variable nature of root phenology. Overall, these phenology responses to climatic change may weaken the close link between fine root production and tree height growth, which may result in temporal mismatch between nutrient demand and supply in Chinese fir plantation.","Qu Z, Lin C, Zhao H, Chen T, Yao X, Wang X, Yang Y, Chen G",The Science of the total environment,2024,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Effects of warming on fine root lifespan of forests: A review.,https://doi.org/10.13287/j.1001-9332.202306.007,"As an important parameter of forests growth, fine root lifespan plays an important role in plant water and nutrient absorption, and affects underground distribution of photosynthetic products and forest ecosystem carbon cycling. The impact of climate warming on fine root lifespan has become a hot issue under the context of global change. The responses of fine root lifespan to global warming will affect ecosystem carbon balance. We reviewed the research progress of the response characteristics and mechanism of fine root lifespan of trees to warming. Most stu-dies proposed that warming would affect fine root lifespan by changing rhizosphere soil environment, fine root morphology, and tree phenology. However, the growth and death of fine roots were affected by lots of factors, leading to differences in the research results on fine root lifespan due to natural environment of the study area, the way of warming, and the research objects. Therefore, it is of importance to comprehensively analyze the responses of fine root lifespan in forests under the background of climate warming to study the underground ecological process. In the future, the following research should be strengthened: 1) Combining multiple methods to warming underground and aboveground simutaneously, and explore more accurate and effective non-destructive observation methods. 2) Combining multiple observations to study the effects of warming on fine root lifespan. 3) Carrying out research on the effect of warming on fine root lifespan of different tree species, and deeply understand the response mechanism of fine root lifespan of different trees to warming. 4) A comprehensive analysis of the effects of warming on fine root lifespan from various perspectives, and an investigation into the mechanism of the combined effects of various factors on fine root lifespan. 5) The interaction between warming and other environmental factors fine root lifespan. 6) The effect of root architecture on the fine root lifespan after warming. 7) The effects of rhizosphere microorganisms (bacteria and fungi) on fine root lifespan after warming.
细根寿命作为林木生长的重要参数,不仅对林木吸收水分和养分能力具有重要作用,而且影响林木对光合产物的地下分配以及森林生态系统碳循环过程。气候变暖对细根寿命的影响已成为全球变化背景下关注的热点问题,细根寿命对全球变暖的响应将影响到生态系统的碳平衡。本文就林木细根寿命对增温的响应特征及其响应机制的研究进展进行综述,以期揭示增温对林木细根寿命的影响。目前已开展的大部分研究认为,增温会通过改变根际土壤环境、细根形态以及林木物候等指标来影响细根寿命。但细根生长和死亡受诸多因素的影响,导致增温对细根寿命影响的研究结果因研究区域自然环境、增温方式和研究对象等因素存在分歧。因此,综合分析气候变暖背景下林木细根寿命的变化对研究地下生态学过程至关重要。今后还应加强以下研究: 1)结合多种方式进行地下、地上同时增温,并探索更准确和有效的无损观测方法;2)结合多种观测手段研究增温对细根寿命的影响;3)开展增温对不同树种细根寿命的研究,深入理解不同林木细根寿命对增温的响应机理;4)多角度综合分析增温对细根寿命的影响特征,探究多种因素综合作用对细根寿命的影响机理;5)增温与其他环境因子对细根寿命交互作用;6)增温后根系层级结构对细根寿命影响;7)增温后根际微生物(细菌、真菌)的改变对细根寿命影响。.","Liu YH, DU XL, Huang JX, Xiong DC",Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,2023,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

Due to the desynchronized growth of above- and below-ground and the buffering of soil, the driving factors in leaf and root show seasonal dynamics.
We measured above- and below-ground intensity in the alpine steppe over the non-growing season (October-April) and growing season (May-September). Air temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, and soil temperature were used to analyze the correlation based on the growth rhythm.
Results showed that an earlier growth in spring and a delayed dormancy in autumn of root than leaf was observed. Our results strongly suggest that soil moisture plays a more important role in leaf unfolding while temperature is consistent with the withering of the shoots. Soil moisture comes from soil melt driving the spring phenology of roots, which derived from the storage of the subsoil layer in the last autumn.
Climate change will affect the strong seasonal patterns that characterized these precipitation-limited systems, especially in the spring and fall shoulder seasons. As seasonality changes in the alpine steppe, divergent responses of leaf and fine root would be explored.","Qin X, Nie X, Wang X, Hong J, Yan Y",Frontiers in plant science,2023,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

We aimed to experimentally test whether the extrinsic driver of soil temperature or the intrinsic driver (resource competition between plant parts) is a more important control for the root and shoot growth of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) seedlings. Sixteen two-year-old seedlings were grown in controlled environment rooms for two simulated growing seasons (GS1, GS2). In GS1, all the seedlings were acclimatized under the same conditions, but in GS2, the soil temperature treatments were: (i) constant 10 °C (Cool); (ii) constant 18 °C (Warm); (iii) early growing season at 10 °C, switched to 18 °C later (Early Cool Late Warm, ECLW) and (iv) early growing season 18 °C, switched to 10 °C later (Early Warm Late Cool, EWLC). The treatments did not affect growth allocation between shoots and roots. Warm soil benefitted shoot elongation as it slowed down in EWLC and accelerated in ECLW after the soil temperature switch. However, whole-tree biomasses were similar to Cool and the seedlings grew largest in Warm. Phenology was not strongly affected by soil temperature, and root and shoot growth did not usually peak simultaneously. Short root mortality increased strongly in ECLW and decreased in EWLC after the soil temperature switch. Long root longevity was not significantly affected but long root growth ceased earliest in ECLW. Soil warming increased foliar nutrient contents. Growth dynamics were not solely driven by soil temperature, but resource competition also played a significant role. The study showed the importance of soil temperature for fine root dynamics not only through root growth but also via root mortality, as soil warming increased mortality even more than growth. Soil temperature has complex effects on tree and soil functioning, which further affects carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems that have a climate feedback.","Kilpeläinen J, Domisch T, Lehto T, Piirainen S, Silvennoinen R, Repo T",Tree physiology,2022,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Eco-archaeological excavation techniques reveal snapshots of subterranean truffle growth.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.funbio.2021.09.001,"Despite its status as a highly-prized and coveted fungi in gastronomy, many aspects of the subterranean life cycle of the Burgundy truffle (Tuber aestivum) are still unknown, because in situ observations of the formation and maturation of truffle fruitbodies remain difficult. Here, we adopted a suite of archaeological fine-scale excavating techniques to provide unique spatiotemporal snapshots of Burgundy truffle growth at three sites in southern Germany. We also recorded the relative position, fresh weight, maturity level and genotype composition of all excavated fruitbodies. Varying by a factor of thousand, the fresh weight of 73 truffle ranged from 0.1 to 103.2 g, with individual maturity levels likely representing different life cycle stages from completely unripe to fully ripe and even decaying. While only a slightly positive relationship between fruitbody weight and maturity level was found, our results suggest that genetically distinct specimens can exhibit different life cycle stages at the same period of time and under the same environmental conditions. We therefore argue that truffles are likely able to grow, mature and ripe simultaneously between early summer and late winter of the following year. Our case study should encourage further eco-archaeological truffle excavations under different biogeographic settings and at different seasons of the year to gain deeper insights into the fungi's subterranean ecology. The expected cross-disciplinary findings will help truffle hunters and farmers to improve their harvest practices and management strategies.","Büntgen U, Peter M, Tegel W, Stobbe U, Elburg R, Sproll L, Molinier V, Čejka T, Isaac EL, Egli S",Fungal biology,2021,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Responses of root phenology in ecotypes of Eriophorum vaginatum to transplantation and warming in the Arctic.,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.149926,"The effect of climate change on phenology and growth is less understood for belowground plant tissues than for aboveground plant tissues, particularly in high-latitude regions. Ecotypes within a species adapted to a locality may display different responses to climate change. We established two common garden plots in the Arctic tundra north of the Brooks Range in northern Alaska. Three ecotypes of Eriophorum vaginatum along a latitudinal gradient were transplanted into common gardens, and half of the transplants were warmed using open-top chambers (OTCs). Minirhizotrons were used to track the root phenology during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. Warming with OTCs (approximately +1 °C in air) did not affect the root biomass, root production or root phenology. The southern ecotype (from 67°16'N) of Eriophorum vaginatum transplanted northward experienced delayed startup and root production compared to two northern ecotypes (from 68°38'N and 69°25'N), although significant differences were not observed in the three ecotypes in terms of root production, root biomass and growth duration at the two sites. Our results suggest that as the climate warms, ecotypes of Eriophorum vaginatum may be able to adjust their duration of root growth and root productivity by phenotypic plasticity, although the degree of plasticity controlling the root startup time may vary between southern and northern ecotypes.","Ma T, Parker T, Unger S, Gewirtzman J, Fetcher N, Moody ML, Tang J",The Science of the total environment,2021,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

10.1093/jxb/eraa487","Pulses are a key component of crop production systems in Southern Australia due to their rotational benefits and potential profit margins. However, cultivation in temperate cropping systems such as that of Southern Australia is limited by low soil water availability and subsoil constraints. This limitation of soil water is compounded by the irregular rainfall, resulting in the absence of plant available water at depth. An increase in the productivity of key pulses and expansion into environments and soil types traditionally considered marginal for their growth will require improved use of the limited soil water and adaptation to sub soil constrains. Roots serve as the interface between soil constraints and the whole plant. Changes in root system architecture (RSA) can be utilised as an adaptive strategy in achieving yield potential under limited rainfall, heterogenous distribution of resources and other soil-based constraints. The existing literature has identified a ""'Steep, Deep and Cheap"" root ideotype as a preferred RSA. However, this idiotype is not efficient in a temperate system where plant available water is limited at depth. In addition, this root ideotype and other root architectural studies have focused on cereal crops, which have different structures and growth patterns to pulses due to their monocotyledonous nature and determinant growth habit. The paucity of pulse-specific root architectural studies warrants further investigations into pulse RSA, which should be combined with an examination of the existing variability of known genetic traits so as to develop strategies to alleviate production constraints through either tolerance or avoidance mechanisms. This review proposes a new model of root system architecture of ""Wide, Shallow and Fine"" roots based on pulse roots in temperate cropping systems. The proposed ideotype has, in addition to other root traits, a root density concentrated in the upper soil layers to capture in-season rainfall before it is lost due to evaporation. The review highlights the potential to achieve this in key pulse crops including chickpea, lentil, faba bean, field pea and lupin. Where possible, comparisons to determinate crops such as cereals have also been made. The review identifies the key root traits that have shown a degree of adaptation via tolerance or avoidance to water stress and documents the current known variability that exists in and amongst pulse crops setting priorities for future research.","Rao S, Armstrong R, Silva-Perez V, Tefera AT, Rosewarne GM","Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2021,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

10.1093/treephys/tpz086","Long-term minirhizotron observations of absorptive fine roots provide insights into seasonal patterns of belowground root production and carbon dynamics. Our objective was to compare root dynamics over time across mature individuals of 11 temperate trees species: five evergreen and six deciduous. We analyzed the timing and growth on 1st-and 2nd-order roots in minirhizotron images down to a vertical depth of 35 cm, as well as monthly and total annual length production. Production patterns were related to total annual precipitation of the actual and previous year of root production over 6 years. The main or largest peak of annual fine-root production occurred between June and September for almost all species and years. In most years, when peaks occurred, the timing of peak root production was synchronized across all species. A linear mixed model revealed significant differences in monthly fine-root length production across species in certain years (species x year, ","Withington JM, Goebel M, Bułaj B, Oleksyn J, Reich PB, Eissenstat DM",Frontiers in plant science,2021,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Dynamics of above- and belowground responses of silver birch saplings and soil gases to soil freezing and waterlogging during dormancy.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpab002,"Winter precipitation and soil freeze-thaw events have been predicted to increase in boreal regions with climate change. This may expose tree roots to waterlogging (WL) and soil freezing (Fr) more than in the current climate and therefore affect tree growth and survival. Using a whole-tree approach, we studied the responses of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) saplings, growing in mineral soil, to 6-week Fr and WL in factorial combinations during dormancy, with accompanying changes in soil gas concentrations. Physiological activation (dark-acclimated chlorophyll fluorescence and chlorophyll content index) and growth of leaves and shoot elongation and stem diameter growth started earlier in Fr than NoFr (soil not frozen). The starch content of leaves was temporarily higher in Fr than NoFr in the latter part of the growing season. Short and long root production and longevity decreased, and mortality increased by soil Fr, while there were no significant effects of WL. Increased fine root damage was followed by increased compensatory root growth. At the beginning of the growing season, stem sap flow increased fastest in Fr + WL, with some delay in both NoWL (without WL) treatments. At the end of the follow-up growing season, the hydraulic conductance and impedance loss factor of roots were higher in Fr than in NoFr, but there were no differences in above- and belowground biomasses. The concentration of soil carbon dioxide increased and methane decreased by soil Fr at the end of dormancy. At the beginning of the growing season, the concentration of nitrous oxide was higher in WL than in NoWL and higher in Fr than in NoFr. In general, soil Fr had more consistent effects on soil greenhouse gas concentrations than WL. To conclude, winter-time WL alone is not as harmful for roots as WL during the growing season.","Repo T, Domisch T, Roitto M, Kilpeläinen J, Wang AF, Piirainen S, Heiskanen J, Makita N, Lehto T, Sutinen S",Tree physiology,2021,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

10.1139/m75-151","Mycorrhizal fungi are critical components of terrestrial habitats and agroecosystems. Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with Lycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted. Our findings are relevant to habitat restoration, species conservation plans, agricultural bio-inoculation treatments, and microbial diversity studies.","Kowal J, Arrigoni E, Serra J, Bidartondo M",Mycorrhiza,2020,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Climatic and physiological regulation of the bimodal xylem formation pattern in Pinus pinaster saplings.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpz099,"Seasonality in tree cambial activity and xylem formation encompass large variation in environmental conditions. Abiotic stressors such as warming or drought also modulate plant behavior at species and individual level. Despite xylem formation susceptibility to carbon (C) and water availability, it is still unknown which are the key physiological variables that regulate xylogenesis, and to what extent plant performance contributes to further explain the number of cells in the different phases of xylem development. Xylogenesis and physiological behavior was monitored in saplings of Pinus pinaster Aiton, a bimodal growth pattern species, distributed in different irrigation regimes. Xylogenesis and plant physiological behavior were compared between treatments and the relationship between climate, physiology and the number of cells in the cambium, enlargement and cell-wall thickening phases was evaluated. Xylogenesis regulation shifted from physiological to climatic control as cell differentiation advanced to mature tracheids. The number of cells in the cambium increased with assimilation rates and decreased with the water potential gradient through the plant. Enlargement was the most susceptible phase to plant relative water content, whereas no physiological variable contributed to explain the number of cells in the wall thickening phase, which declined as temperatures increased. All treatments showed a bimodal growth pattern with a second growth period starting when primary growth was completed and after plants had experienced the highest summer hydraulic losses. Our study demonstrates the importance of including physiological responses and not only climate to fully understand xylogenesis, with special attention to the enlargement phase. This is critical when studying species with a bimodal growth pattern because the second growth peak responds to internal shifts of C allocation and may strongly depend on plant hydraulic responses and not on a fine tuning of cambial activity with soil water availability.","Garcia-Forner N, Vieira J, Nabais C, Carvalho A, Martínez-Vilalta J, Campelo F",Tree physiology,2019,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

The extent to which plant roots can reach and interact with these hitherto detached, deep carbon and nitrogen stores remains unknown. We aimed to quantify how permafrost thaw affects root dynamics across soil depths and plant functional types compared with above-ground abundance, and potential consequences for plant-soil interactions. A decade of experimental permafrost thaw strongly increased total root length and growth in the active layer, and deep roots invaded the newly thawed permafrost underneath. Root litter input to soil across all depths was 10 times greater with permafrost thaw. Root growth timing was unaffected by experimental permafrost thaw but peaked later in deeper soil, reflecting the seasonally receding thaw front.

We sought to characterize the progression of root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), dark septate endophytes (DSE), and fine root endophytes (FRE) over an alpine growing season, and to understand the role of the host plant and environment in driving colonization levels. We sampled four forbs on a regular schedule from June 26th-September 11th from a moist meadow (3535 m a.s.l) on Niwot Ridge, Rocky Mountain Front Range, CO, USA. We quantified the degree of root colonization by storage structures, exchange structures, and hyphae of all three groups of fungi. AMF and FRE percent colonization fluctuated significantly over time, while DSE did not. All AMF structures changed over time, and the degree of change in vesicles differed by plant species. FRE hyphae, AMF arbuscules and AMF vesicles peaked late in the season as plants produced seeds. AMF hyphae levels started high, decreased, and then increased within 20 days, highlighting the dynamic nature of plant-fungal interactions. Overall, our results show that AMF and FRE, not DSE, root colonization rapidly changes over the course of a growing season and these changes are driven by plant phenology and seasonal changes in the environment.","Bueno de Mesquita CP, Martinez Del Río CM, Suding KN, Schmidt SK",Mycorrhiza,2018,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
To spend or to save? Assessing energetic growth-storage tradeoffs in native and invasive woody plants.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-018-4177-4,"Many non-native woody plants invade low-light forest understories but differ from native species in leaf phenology and seasonality of photosynthesis. It is unknown whether such differences in assimilation patterns are due to contrasting strategies of energy allocation. In a group of native and invasive species in Eastern North America, we hypothesized that invaders employ a grow-first strategy, prioritizing allocation to new structural biomass over carbon storage compared to native congeners. We also hypothesized that species producing a single spring leaf flush exhibit a more conservative carbon storage strategy than species with continuous leaf production. We measured sugar and starch concentrations (non-structural carbohydrates; NSCs) in spring and fall in the stems and roots of 39 species of native and non-native shrubs in a common garden, and compared these to patterns of leaf production across species. Native species had higher soluble sugar concentrations than invaders, but invaders tended to store more root starch in spring. We found no difference in leaf production between natives and invaders. Determinate species had more soluble sugars than indeterminate species but had lower root starch. We found no relationship between aboveground productivity and carbon storage. Our results suggest that closely related species with contrasting evolutionary histories have different carbon storage strategies, although not necessarily in relation to their growth potential. The higher soluble sugar concentrations of native species may reflect their evolutionary response to historical disturbances, or different interactions with soil microbes, while increased spring root starch in invaders may support fine root or fruit production.","Hinman ED, Fridley JD",Oecologia,2018,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Stand development and other intrinsic factors largely control fine-root dynamics with only subtle modifications from resource availability.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpy033,"Forest productivity depends on resource acquisition by ephemeral roots and leaves. A combination of intrinsic and environmental factors influences ephemeral organs; however, difficulties in studying belowground organs impede mechanistic understanding of fine-root production and turnover. To quantify factors controlling fine-root dynamics, we grew a deciduous hardwood (Populus deltoides Bartr.) and an evergreen conifer (Pinus taeda L.) with distinct soil moisture and nutrient availability treatments. We monitored fine-root dynamics with minirhizotrons for 6 years during early stand development and expressed results on a root length, biomass and mortality-risk basis. Stand development and other intrinsic factors consistently influenced both species in the same direction and by similar magnitude. Live-root length increased to a peak during establishment and slowly declined after roots of neighboring trees overlapped. Root longevity was highest during establishment and decreased thereafter. Root longevity consistently increased with depth of appearance and initial root diameter. Season of appearance affected root longevity in the following order: spring > summer > fall > winter. The influence of soil resource availability on fine-root dynamics was inconsistent between species, and ranked below that of rooting depth, initial diameter, stand development and phenology. Fine-root biomass either increased or was unaffected by greater resource availability. Fine-root production and live root length decreased with irrigation for both species, and increased with fertilization only for poplar. Fine-root mortality risk both increased and decreased depending on species and amendment treatment. Differing responses to soil moisture and nutrient availability between species suggests we should carefully evaluate generalizations about the response of fine-root dynamics to resource availability. While attempting to describe and explain carbon allocation to fine-root production and turnover, modelers and physiologists should first consider consistent patterns of allocation caused by different depth, diameter, stand development, phenology and species before considering allocation due to soil resource availability.","Coleman MD, Aubrey DP",Tree physiology,2018,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

10.1016/j.tplants.2009.07.002","Restoration of an adequate water supply in spring is a prerequisite for survival of angiosperm trees in temperate regions. Trees must re-establish access to soil water and recover xylem functionality. We thus hypothesized that prolonged soil frost impairs recovery and affects hydraulics and phenology of Malus domestica var. 'Golden Delicious.' To test this hypothesis, over two consecutive winters the soil around some trees was insulated to prolong soil frosting, From mid-winter to early summer, the level of native embolism, the water and starch contents of wood, bark and buds were quantified at regular intervals and findings correlated with various phenological parameters, xylogenesis and fine root growth. The findings confirm that prolonged soil frost affects tree hydraulics and phenology but the severity of the effect depends on the climatic conditions. In both study years, percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity (PLC) decreased from about 70% at the end of winter to about 10% in May. Thereby, xylem refilling strongly coincided with a decrease of starch in wood and bark. Also treated trees were able to restore their hydraulic system by May but, in the warm spring of 2012, xylem refilling, the increases in water content and starch depolymerization were delayed. In contrast, in the cold spring of 2013 only small differences between control and treated trees were observed. Prolongation of soil frost also led to a delay in phenology, xylogenesis, and fine root growth. We conclude that reduced water uptake from frozen or cold soils impairs refilling and thus negatively impacts tree hydraulics and growth of apple trees in spring. Under unfavorable circumstances, this may cause severe winter damage or even dieback.","Beikircher B, Mittmann C, Mayr S",Frontiers in plant science,2016,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
"Summer dormancy, drought survival and functional resource acquisition strategies in California perennial grasses.",https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcw109,"Evidence suggests drought severity is increasing due to climate change, but strategies promoting severe drought survival in perennial grasses have been seldom explored. This is particularly true of summer dormancy, an adaptation common in summer-dry Mediterranean-type climates. In addition, though theory predicts superior drought survival results in lower potential productivity, studies rarely measure both drought survival and growth under optimal conditions.
Physiological and functional ecological approaches were integrated to quantify interspecific variation in foliar and root traits in a suite of eight California perennial grass species. In a glasshouse experiment, summer dormancy, foliar functional trait variation, and seasonal growth and phenology under non-limiting water conditions and dehydration tolerance under progressive drought were quantified. In a second glasshouse study, root functional traits were quantified under non-limiting water conditions in rhizotrons.
Summer dormancy was associated with higher dehydration tolerance, and negatively associated with traits conferring dehydration avoidance. Species with greater summer dormancy were characterized by greater springtime productivity, earlier reproduction, and a shallow and fine root system, which are indicative of dehydration escape. Summer dormancy was associated with an acquisitive, competitive functional strategy in spring, and a conservative strategy in summer.
Both the escape and acquisitive springtime strategies observed in summer dormant perennial taxa are typically associated with annual grasses. California grasslands were once dominated by perennial species, but have been overtaken by non-native Mediterranean annual grasses, which are expected to be further favoured by climate change. Owing to functional similarity with these exotic annuals, it is suggested that native summer dormant taxa may play an important ecological role in the future of both natural and restored California grasslands.","Balachowski JA, Bristiel PM, Volaire FA",Annals of botany,2016,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

10.3389/fpls.2013.00272","Abies alba (European silver fir) was used to investigate possible effects of simulated browsing on C allocation belowground by 13CO2 pulse-labelling at spring, summer or autumn, and by harvesting the trees at the same time point of the labelling or at a later season for biomass and for 13C-allocation into the fine-root system. Before budburst in spring, the leader shoots and 50% of all lateral shoots of half of the investigated 5-year old Abies alba saplings were clipped to simulate browsing. At harvest, different fine-root classes were separated, and starch as an important storage compartment was analysed for concentrations. The phenology had a strong effect on the allocation of the 13C-label from shoots to roots. In spring, shoots did not supply the fine-roots with high amounts of the 13C-label, because the fine-roots contained less than 1% of the applied 13C. In summer and autumn, however, shoots allocated relatively high amounts of the 13C-label to the fine roots. The incorporation of the 13C-label as structural C or as starch into the roots is strongly dependent on the root type and the root diameter. In newly formed fine roots, 3-5% of the applied 13C was incorporated, whereas 1-3% in the ≤0.5 mm root class and 1-1.5% in the >0.5-1.0 mm root class were recorded. Highest 13C-enrichment in the starch was recorded in the newly formed fine roots in autumn. The clipping treatment had a significant positive effect on the amount of allocated 13C-label to the fine roots after the spring labelling, with high relative 13C-contents observed in the ≤0.5 mm and the >0.5-1.0 mm fine-root classes of clipped trees. No effects of the clipping were observed after summer and autumn labelling in the 13C-allocation patterns. Overall, our data imply that the season of C assimilation and, thus, the phenology of trees is the main determinant of the C allocation from shoots to roots and is clearly more important than browsing.","Endrulat T, Buchmann N, Brunner I",PloS one,2016,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
"Impact of treated wastewater on growth, respiration and hydraulic conductivity of citrus root systems in light and heavy soils.",https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpw013,"Roots interact with soil properties and irrigation water quality leading to changes in root growth, structure and function. We studied these interactions in an orchard and in lysimeters with clay and sandy loam soils. Minirhizotron imaging and manual sampling showed that root growth was three times lower in the clay relative to sandy loam soil. Treated wastewater (TWW) led to a large reduction in root growth with clay (45-55%) but not with sandy loam soil (<20%). Treated wastewater increased salt uptake, membrane leakage and proline content, and decreased root viability, carbohydrate content and osmotic potentials in the fine roots, especially in clay. These results provide evidence that TWW challenges and damages the root system. The phenology and physiology of root orders were studied in lysimeters. Soil type influenced diameter, specific root area, tissue density and cortex area similarly in all root orders, while TWW influenced these only in clay soil. Respiration rates were similar in both soils, and root hydraulic conductivity was severely reduced in clay soil. Treated wastewater increased respiration rate and reduced hydraulic conductivity of all root orders in clay but only of the lower root orders in sandy loam soil. Loss of hydraulic conductivity increased with root order in clay and clay irrigated with TWW. Respiration and hydraulic properties of all root orders were significantly affected by sodium-amended TWW in sandy loam soil. These changes in root order morphology, anatomy, physiology and hydraulic properties indicate rapid and major modifications of root systems in response to differences in soil type and water quality.","Paudel I, Cohen S, Shaviv A, Bar-Tal A, Bernstein N, Heuer B, Ephrath J",Tree physiology,2016,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth

10.1093/treephys/23.13.865","Factors regulating fine-root growth are poorly understood, particularly in fruit tree species. In this context, the effects of N addition on the temporal and spatial distribution of fine-root growth and on the fine-root turnover were assessed in irrigated sweet cherry trees. The influence of other exogenous and endogenous factors was also examined. The rhizotron technique was used to measure the length-based fine-root growth in trees fertilized at two N rates (0 and 60 kg ha(-1)), and the above-ground growth, leaf net assimilation, and air and soil variables were simultaneously monitored. N fertilization exerted a basal effect throughout the season, changing the magnitude, temporal patterns and spatial distribution of fine-root production and mortality. Specifically, N addition enhanced the total fine-root production by increasing rates and extending the production period. On average, N-fertilized trees had a length-based production that was 110-180% higher than in control trees, depending on growing season. Mortality was proportional to production, but turnover rates were inconsistently affected. Root production and mortality was homogeneously distributed in the soil profile of N-fertilized trees while control trees had 70-80% of the total fine-root production and mortality concentrated below 50 cm depth. Root mortality rates were associated with soil temperature and water content. In contrast, root production rates were primarily under endogenous control, specifically through source-sink relationships, which in turn were affected by N supply through changes in leaf photosynthetic level. Therefore, exogenous and endogenous factors interacted to control the fine-root dynamics of irrigated sweet cherry trees.","Artacho P, Bonomelli C",Tree physiology,2016,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
The hidden season: growing season is 50% longer below than above ground along an arctic elevation gradient.,https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.13655,"There is compelling evidence from experiments and observations that climate warming prolongs the growing season in arctic regions. Until now, the start, peak, and end of the growing season, which are used to model influences of vegetation on biogeochemical cycles, were commonly quantified using above-ground phenological data. Yet, over 80% of the plant biomass in arctic regions can be below ground, and the timing of root growth affects biogeochemical processes by influencing plant water and nutrient uptake, soil carbon input and microbial activity. We measured timing of above- and below-ground production in three plant communities along an arctic elevation gradient over two growing seasons. Below-ground production peaked later in the season and was more temporally uniform than above-ground production. Most importantly, the growing season continued c. 50% longer below than above ground. Our results strongly suggest that traditional above-ground estimates of phenology in arctic regions, including remotely sensed information, are not as complete a representation of whole-plant production intensity or duration, as studies that include root phenology. We therefore argue for explicit consideration of root phenology in studies of carbon and nutrient cycling, in terrestrial biosphere models, and scenarios of how arctic ecosystems will respond to climate warming.","Blume-Werry G, Wilson SD, Kreyling J, Milbau A",The New phytologist,2015,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Seasonal changes in carbon and nitrogen compound concentrations in a Quercus petraea chronosequence.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tpu060,"Forest productivity declines with tree age. This decline may be due to changes in metabolic functions, resource availability and/or changes in resource allocation (between growth, reproduction and storage) with tree age. Carbon and nitrogen remobilization/storage processes are key to tree growth and survival. However, studies of the effects of tree age on these processes are scarce and have not yet considered seasonal carbon and nitrogen variations in situ. This study was carried out in a chronosequence of sessile oak (Quercus petraea Liebl.) for 1 year to survey the effects of tree age on the seasonal changes of carbon and nitrogen compounds in several tree compartments, focusing on key phenological stages. Our results highlight a general pattern of carbon and nitrogen function at all tree ages, with carbon reserve remobilization at budburst for growth, followed by carbon reserve formation during the leafy season and carbon reserve use during winter for maintenance. The variation in concentrations of nitrogen compounds shows less amplitude than that of carbon compounds. Storage as proteins occurs later, and mainly depends on leaf nitrogen remobilization and root uptake in autumn. We highlight several differences between tree age groups, in particular the loss of carbon storage function of fine and medium-sized roots with tree ageing. Moreover, the pattern of carbon compound accumulation in branches supports the hypothesis of a preferential allocation of carbon towards growth until the end of wood formation in juvenile trees, at the expense of the replenishment of carbon stores, while mature trees start allocating carbon to storage right after budburst. Our results demonstrate that at key phenological stages, physiological and developmental functions differ with tree age, and together with environmental conditions, influence the carbon and nitrogen concentration variations in sessile oaks.","Gilson A, Barthes L, Delpierre N, Dufrêne É, Fresneau C, Bazot S",Tree physiology,2014,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Links between belowground and aboveground resource-related traits reveal species growth strategies that promote invasive advantages.,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0104189,"Belowground processes are rarely considered in comparison studies of native verses invasive species. We examined relationships between belowground fine root production and lifespan, leaf phenology, and seasonal nitrogen dynamics of Lonicera japonica (non-native) versus L. sempervirens (native) and Frangula alnus (non-native) versus Rhamnus alnifolia (native), over time. First and second order fine roots were monitored from 2010 to 2012 using minirhizotron technology and rhizotron windows. 15N uptake of fine roots was measured across spring and fall seasons. Significant differences in fine root production across seasons were seen between Lonicera species, but not between Frangula and Rhamnus, with both groups having notable asynchrony in regards to the timing of leaf production. Root order and the number of root neighbors at the time of root death were the strongest predictors of root lifespan of both species pairs. Seasonal 15N uptake was higher in spring than in the fall, which did not support the need for higher root activity to correspond with extended leaf phenology. We found higher spring 15N uptake in non-native L. japonica compared to native L. sempervirens, although there was no difference in 15N uptake between Frangula and Rhamnus species. Our findings indicate the potential for fast-growing non-native Lonicera japonica and Frangula alnus to outcompete native counterparts through differences in biomass allocation, root turnover, and nitrogen uptake, however evidence that this is a general strategy of invader dominance is limited.","Smith MS, Fridley JD, Goebel M, Bauerle TL",PloS one,2014,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Intra-annual nutrient flux in Pinus taeda.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/tps082,"Intra-annual nutrient (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium) flux was quantified for Pinus taeda L. at a nutrient-poor, well-drained sandy site in Scotland County, NC, USA where a 2 × 2 factorial of irrigation and nutrition was applied in four replications in a 10-year-old stand with 1200 stems ha(-1). Treatments were applied with the goal of providing optimum nutrition (no nutritional deficiencies) and water availability. Component (foliage, branch, stem and root) nutrient content was estimated monthly for 2 years using nutrient concentration and phenology assessments combined with destructive harvests. Positive flux values indicated nutrient accumulation in the trees while negative values indicated nutrient loss from the trees. Fertilization significantly increased nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium and magnesium flux 140%, on average, over non-fertilized. Irrigation significantly increased calcium flux 28% while there was no significant irrigation effect on nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or magnesium. Maximum nutrient fluxes (kg ha(-1) day(-1)) for non-fertilized and fertilized stands were 0.36 and 1.05 for nitrogen, 0.042 and 0.095 for phosphorus, 0.13 and 0.51 for potassium, 0.27 and 0.42 for calcium, and 0.04 and 0.12 for magnesium, respectively. Maximum flux was coincident with ephemeral tissue (foliage and fine root) development and likely would be higher in stands with more foliage than those observed in this study (projected leaf area indices were 1.5 and 3.0 for the non-fertilized and fertilized stands). Minimum nutrient fluxes (kg ha(-1) day(-1)) for non-fertilized and fertilized stands were -0.18 and -0.42 for nitrogen, -0.029 and -0.070 for phosphorus, -0.05 and -0.18 for potassium, -0.04 and -0.05 for calcium, and -0.02 and -0.03 for magnesium, respectively. Minimum fluxes were typically observed in the dormant season and were linked to foliage senescence and branch death. Foliage and branch component nutrient contents were out of phase for nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, indicating nutrient retranslocation and storage in branches prior to foliage development and after foliage senescence. In contrast to current operational fertilizer programs which often target winter application these data suggest the best application times would be during foliage development.","Albaugh TJ, Allen HL, Stape JL, Fox TR, Rubilar RA, Price JW",Tree physiology,2012,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Dynamics of phreatophyte root growth relative to a seasonally fluctuating water table in a Mediterranean-type environment.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-012-2381-1,"While seasonal redistribution of fine root biomass in response to fluctuations in groundwater level is often inferred in phreatophytic plants, few studies have observed the in situ growth dynamics of deep roots relative to those near the surface. We investigated the root growth dynamics of two Banksia species accessing a seasonally dynamic water table and hypothesized that root growth phenology varied with depth, i.e. root growth closest to the water table would be influenced by water table dynamics rather than surface micro-climate. Root in-growth bags were used to observe the dynamics of root growth at different soil depths and above-ground growth was also assessed to identify whole-plant growth phenology. Root growth at shallow depths was found to be in synchrony with above-ground growth phenophases, following increases in ambient temperature and soil water content. In contrast, root growth at depth was either constant or suppressed by saturation. Root growth above the water table and within the capillary fringe occurred in all seasons, corresponding with consistent water availability and aerobic conditions. However, at the water table, a seasonal cycle of root elongation with drawdown in summer followed by trimming in response to water table rise and saturation in winter, was observed. The ability to grow roots year-round at the capillary fringe and redistribute fine root biomass in response to groundwater drawdown is considered critical in allowing phreatophytes, in seasonally water-limited environments, to maintain access to groundwater throughout the year.","Canham CA, Froend RH, Stock WD, Davies M",Oecologia,2012,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Elevated CO2 and O3 effects on fine-root survivorship in ponderosa pine mesocosms.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00442-009-1339-4,"Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) concentrations are rising, which may have opposing effects on tree C balance and allocation to fine roots. More information is needed on interactive CO(2) and O(3) effects on roots, particularly fine-root life span, a critical demographic parameter and determinant of soil C and N pools and cycling rates. We conducted a study in which ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) seedlings were exposed to two levels of CO(2) and O(3) in sun-lit controlled-environment mesocosms for 3 years. Minirhizotrons were used to monitor individual fine roots in three soil horizons every 28 days. Proportional hazards regression was used to analyze effects of CO(2), O(3), diameter, depth, and season of root initiation on fine-root survivorship. More fine roots were produced in the elevated CO(2) treatment than in ambient CO(2). Elevated CO(2), increasing root diameter, and increasing root depth all significantly increased fine-root survivorship and median life span. Life span was slightly, but not significantly, lower in elevated O(3), and increased O(3) did not reduce the effect of elevated CO(2). Median life spans varied from 140 to 448 days depending on the season of root initiation. These results indicate the potential for elevated CO(2) to increase the number of fine roots and their residence time in the soil, which is also affected by root diameter, root depth, and phenology.","Phillips DL, Johnson MG, Tingey DT, Storm MJ",Oecologia,2009,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Dry-season leaf flushing of Enterolobium cyclocarpum (ear-pod tree): above- and below-ground phenology and water relations.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/27.11.1561,"Above- and belowground phenology and water relations of Enterolobium cyclocarpum Jacq. trees in the dry forest of Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica were studied during two consecutive phenological cycles, from November 1998 to June 2000. Aboveground phenological activity, including leaf shedding, growth and maturation of dormant fruits, new leaf flushing and flowering, occurred during the dry season. Measurements of leaf water potential, stomatal conductance and sap flow indicated that stomata of newly flushed leaves remained essentially closed until the onset of the first rains, suggesting that the main factor accounting for the favorable water balance of dry-season flushed leaves was their capacity to restrict water loss. Evidence of a contribution from stem and root water stores to shoot expansion was mixed because only the first dry-season flushing episode monitored was accompanied by a marked decrease in stem and root water potentials. Fine root production did not precede leaf flushing, occurred only after the onset of the rainy season and stopped under drought conditions, suggesting that soil water content was the most important variable controlling fine root dynamics in this species.","Rojas-Jiménez K, Holbrook NM, Gutiérrez-Soto MV",Tree physiology,2007,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Genetic and environmental control of seasonal carbohydrate dynamics in trees of diverse Pinus sylvestris populations.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/20.12.837,"We explored environmental and genetic factors affecting seasonal dynamics of starch and soluble nonstructural carbohydrates in needle and twig cohorts and roots of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees of six populations originating between 49 degrees and 60 degrees N, and grown under common garden conditions in western Poland. Trees of each population were sampled once or twice per month over a 3-year period from age 15 to 17 years. Based on similarity in starch concentration patterns in needles, two distinct groups of populations were identified; one comprised northern populations from Sweden and Russia (59-60 degrees N), and another comprised central European populations from Latvia, Poland, Germany and France (49-56 degrees N). Needle starch concentrations of northern populations started to decline in late spring and reached minimum values earlier than those of central populations. For all populations, starch accumulation in spring started when minimum air temperature permanently exceeded 0 degrees C. Starch accumulation peaked before bud break and was highest in 1-year-old needles, averaging 9-13% of dry mass. Soluble carbohydrate concentrations were lowest in spring and summer and highest in autumn and winter. There were no differences among populations in seasonal pattern of soluble carbohydrate concentrations. Averaged across all populations, needle soluble carbohydrate concentrations increased from about 4% of needle dry mass in developing current-year needles, to about 9% in 1- and 2-year-old needles. Root carbohydrate concentration exhibited a bimodal pattern with peaks in spring and autumn. Northern populations had higher concentrations of fine-root starch in spring and autumn than central populations. Late-summer carbohydrate accumulation in roots started only after depletion of starch in needles and woody shoots. We conclude that Scots pine carbohydrate dynamics depend partially on inherited properties that are probably related to phenology of root and shoot growth.","Oleksyn J, Zytkowiak R, Karolewski P, Reich PB, Tjoelker MG",Tree physiology,2003,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Below-ground carbon input to soil is controlled by nutrient availability and fine root dynamics in loblolly pine.,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1469-8137.2002.00393.x,"•  Availability of growth limiting resources may alter root dynamics in forest ecosystems, possibly affecting the land-atmosphere exchange of carbon. This was evaluated for a commercially important southern timber species by installing a factorial experiment of fertilization and irrigation treatments in an 8-yr-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantation. •  After 3 yr of growth, production and turnover of fine, coarse and mycorrhizal root length was observed using minirhizotrons, and compared with stem growth and foliage development. •  Fertilization increased net production of fine roots and mycorrhizal roots, but did not affect coarse roots. Fine roots had average lifespans of 166 d, coarse roots 294 d and mycorrhizal roots 507 d. Foliage growth rate peaked in late spring and declined over the remainder of the growing season, whereas fine roots experienced multiple growth flushes in the spring, summer and fall. •  We conclude that increased nutrient availability might increase carbon input to soils through enhanced fine root turnover. However, this will depend on the extent to which mycorrhizal root formation is affected, as these mycorrhizal roots have much longer average lifespans than fine and coarse roots.","King JS, Albaugh TJ, Allen HL, Buford M, Strain BR, Dougherty P",The New phytologist,2002,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Water stress responses of seedlings of four Mediterranean oak species.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/20.16.1065,"Effects of water stress on phenology, growth, stomatal activity and water status were assessed from April to November 1996 in 2-year-old seedlings of Quercus frainetto Ten. (Quercus conferta Kit.), Quercus pubescens Willd., Quercus macrolepis Kotschy (Quercus aegilops auct.) and Quercus ilex L. growing in containers in northern Greece. All four species developed more than 50% of their total leaf area before the beginning of June--an adaptation to arid climates. Well-irrigated plants tended to develop greater individual leaf area, number of leaves per plant, total plant leaf area, height and root:shoot ratios than water-stressed plants, but the difference between treatments was not significant for any parameter in any species. Quercus macrolepis appeared to be the most drought-tolerant of the four species. It maintained the highest number of leaves of the smallest size and increased the proportion of fine roots during drought. In all species, drought caused significant decreases in stomatal conductance and predawn and midday water potentials from mid-July until the end of August, when the lowest soil water content and highest mean daily air temperatures and midday leaf temperatures occurred; however, the responses were species-specific. Among the four species, Quercus macrolepis sustained the highest stomatal conductance despite very low water potentials, thus overcoming drought by means of desiccation tolerance. Quercus ilex decreased stomatal conductance even before severe water stress occurred, thereby avoiding desication during drought. Quercus pubescens had the highest water potential despite a high stomatal conductance, indicating that its leaf water status was independent of stomatal activity. Quercus frainetto was the least drought-resistant of the four species. During drought it developed very low water potentials despite markedly reduced stomatal aperture.","Fotelli MN, Radoglou KM, Constantinidou HI",Tree physiology,2001,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
The influence of below ground herbivory and plant competition on growth and biomass allocation of purple loosestrife.,https://doi.org/10.1007/s004420050356,"Experiments investigating plant-herbivore interactions have primarily focused on above-ground herbivory, with occasional studies evaluating the effect of below-ground herbivores on plant performance. This study investigated the growth of the wetland perennial Lythrum salicaria (purple loosestrife) under three levels of root herbivory by the weevil Hylobiustransversovittatus and three levels of plant competition by the grass Phleumpratense in a common garden. Plant growth, flowering phenology, and biomass allocation patterns of purple loosestrife were recorded for two growing seasons. During the first year, root herbivory reduced plant height; plant competition delayed flowering; and the interaction of root herbivory and plant competition resulted in reductions in plant height, shoot weight and total dry biomass. Plant competition or larval feeding did not affect the biomass allocation pattern in the first year. These results indicate the importance of interactions of plant competition and herbivory in reducing plant performance - at least during the establishment period of purple loosestrife. In the second growing season, root herbivory reduced plant height, biomass of all plant parts, delayed and shortened the flowering period, and changed the biomass allocation patterns. Plant competition delayed flowering and reduced the dry weight of fine roots. The interaction of root herbivory and plant competition delayed flowering. Root herbivory was more important than plant competition in reducing the performance of established purple loosestrife plants. This was due, in part, to intense intraspecific competition among the grass individuals effectively preventing shoot elongation of P. pratense and resulting in a carpet like growth.","Nötzold R, Blossey B, Newton E",Oecologia,1997,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Seasonal branch and fine root growth of juvenile loblolly pine five growing seasons after fertilization.,https://doi.org/10.1093/treephys/16.11-12.899,"In 1989, we established two replications of two fertilization treatments in a 10-year-old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantation. Between March and September 1993, branch internode and needle fascicle expansion in the upper and lower third of crowns were measured weekly on three south-facing branches of each of four trees, and new root initiation and elongation were measured at 10-day intervals in three vertical rhizotrons per plot. In one replication, soil water content was measured daily. Fertilization significantly increased the expansion of first flush internodes in the upper crown and first flush needle fascicles in the upper and lower crown. New root growth was stimulated by fertilization in the second half of the growing season. The timing of root growth responses to fertilization corresponded to branch phenologies in the upper and lower crown that were conducive to increased basipetal transport of photosynthate. We conclude, therefore, that new root growth was linked to source-sink activities in the crown. Root initiation was greater in the upper than in the lower part of the soil profile; however, as the growing season progressed and water deficit increased, this relationship was reversed. The effect of soil depth on seasonal root growth was closely associated with water availability, suggesting that root initiation deep in the soil profile is critical for the continued production of new roots in environments subjected to short-term, but relatively severe, water deficits.","Sword MA, Gravatt DA, Faulkner PL, Chambers JL",Tree physiology,1996,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
Root proliferation characteristics of seven perennial arid-land grasses in nutrient-enriched microsites.,https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00317089,"We compared root proliferation in fertilized microsites among seven cultivars of five commonly planted cool-desert perennial grass species that differ in productivity and competitive ability. In a greenhouse experiment on nutrient-limited plants, one soil microsite in each pot received distilled water (control) and a second microsite received a rich, complete nutrient solution (fertilized). Roots in and adjacent to the microsites were mapped on Mylar windows for 22 days after the injections to determine the magnitude and timing of response in root length relative growth rates (RGRs). Because we provided adequate water, used a high level of fertilization in the treatment microsites, and conducted the experiments during rapid vegetative growth, the results provide a measure of the relative capacities and maximal rates of the grasses responses to enriched microsites. Root samples were harvested from control and fertilized microsites at the end of the experiment to determine the morphological basis of the proliferation response. In all seven grasses fine roots proliferated in the fertilized microsites faster than in the control microsites. The grasses did not differ in the timing of their response which showed a peak 7-8 days after injection. Although one species, Pseudoroegneria spicata cv. Goldar, had higher maximum root length RGR and higher RGR ratio (RGR in fertilized to RGR in control microsites) 7-8 days after injection, the seven grasses did not differ significantly in the magnitude of root length RGR response to fertilizer integrated over the 22 day experiment. The grasses also did not differ significantly in root morphological changes in fertilized mocrosites. Compared to roots in control microsites, roots in fertilized microsites had greater specific root length, length of secondary roots per length of main axis, number of lateral and sublateral roots per length of main axis, and mean lateral root length. Root proliferation was mainly the result of increased lateral branching and lateral root growth in all seven grasses. The consistency of root proliferation responses among these seven cultivars suggests that differences in the capacity for, maximum rate, or morphological basis of root proliferation are not directly related to ecological characteristics such as productivity and competitive ability. Other aspects of root response to nutrient enrichment, such as differential responses as a function of microsite nutrient concentration, plant phenology, plant nutrient status, or specific nutrient element(s), may still be important, but further experiments are required to determine whether different responses to enriched soil microsites among species correspond with know species differences in ecological characteristics.","Larigauderie A, Richards JH",Oecologia,1994,,roots AND phenology AND fine roots AND growth
